# RocketMedia
Take Home Challenge

Thank you for applying for the Junior Developer position at Rocket Media. As part of the application process, please code the attached responsive component. Write all necessary HTML and CSS, and then post it on a website, or on Github, or just email us your code. Lay the component out on the page however you see fit. Target the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, as well as IE11. We’ll ask you to talk about your process and the code during any subsequent in-person interviews.

Also, see the attached Craft CMS/Twig template. This is a (very slightly) simplified template from one of our sites. Please review this template and be prepared to explain it as best you can during your in-person interview. It’s okay if not all of it makes sense, but do your best to figure out what is going on.

Please respond with the completed assessment by Friday, February 2nd. Feel free to reach out to me or Kelly with any questions. Happy coding!
